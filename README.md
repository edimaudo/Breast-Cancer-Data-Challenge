# Breast-Cancer-Data-Challenge

## Background 
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection through screening and diagnostic imaging (e.g., mammograms, biopsies) significantly improves treatment outcomes. Breast cancer originates when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control, forming a tumor that can be felt as a lump or seen on an imaging test.  Data-driven models can help classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on characteristics derived from cell nuclei in digital images.

The solution is in an .ipynb file [Breast Cancer Notebooks](https://github.com/edimaudo/Gut-Microbe-Disease-Classification/blob/main/Gut_Health_Classification.ipynb).

## How to run the file
Running a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) can be achieved through several methods, primarily using Jupyter Notebook itself, cloud-based services like Google Colab, or integrated development environments (IDEs) like VS Code.

Using Jupyter Notebook (Local Installation):
Install Jupyter Notebook: If you don't have it, install Anaconda (which includes Jupyter) or install Jupyter Notebook directly via pip:
Code

```
    pip install notebook
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook: Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and type:
Code
```
    jupyter notebook
```
This will open a new tab in your web browser, displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
Navigate and Open: In the dashboard, navigate to the directory where your .ipynb file is located and click on the file name to open it.
Run Cells: Once the notebook is open, you can run individual cells by clicking the "Run" button or using keyboard shortcuts like Shift + Enter (run and move to next cell) or Ctrl + Enter (run and stay on current cell).
Stop the Server: Close the browser tab and then stop the server running in your terminal/command prompt (usually by pressing Ctrl + C).
